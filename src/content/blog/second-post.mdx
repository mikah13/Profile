- The text below is from the [Tailwind CSS](https://play.tailwindcss.com/uj1vGACRJA?layout=preview) docs. I copied it here to test the markdown styles. **Tailwind is awesome. You should use it.**
- The CSS is from MDX sites I've built through the years. I copied this from [Nextra](https://github.com/shuding/nextra) and tweaked it a bit to fit the styles of this site.
